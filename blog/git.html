      Working with the command line this week has been difficult, but rewarding. After taking my first glance through this weeks material I was very worried. Nothing was working for me and it all started to build up. When I started taking it step by step and talking myself through what I was doing I noticed that by the end I wasn't going back into my notes to look up the git commands at all. The "Command Line Crash Course" helped me the most. I spent a lot of time reading and rereading through it and it payed off in the end.

        Working with version control is important because you want to be able to work together and collaborate with your teammates. It keeps thee workflow running smoothly and is overall just more productive. Version control allows you and your teammates to work on the same set of files without having to worry about ruining the code in the file. It gives you the ability to work freely and later still be able to merge your files to create the best possible outcome.

        Another helpful feature about git is its ability to help you keep track of your changes. Git follows all of your changes inside of a git tracked folder. Git uses a "commit" to essentially save your progress up to that point. After making changes to your code it is always a good idea to use the command "git status" to verify where you are in your process. This command will give you feedback being one of the following: Changes to be committed, untracked files, changes not staged for commit. Depending on the feedback you recieve determines your next step. Keeping in mind the only way to "push" your chanes is if the file is already committed.

        GitHub is a valuable resource while working with git coding. GitHub acts as a "home base" for you and your teammates to access eachothers repositories to modify your code and give feedback. Rather than only being able to save your git code locally on your computer, GitHub allows you to save it in an easily accessible public space. The project owners are able to accept or decline pull requests from others that want to copy their code.
